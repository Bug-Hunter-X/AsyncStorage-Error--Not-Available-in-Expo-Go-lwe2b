This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test an app that uses AsyncStorage.  The AsyncStorage API might throw an error, such as `AsyncStorage: not available`, indicating that it's unavailable or inaccessible within the Expo Go environment. This typically happens because AsyncStorage relies on the device's file system, which has limitations in Expo Go.

```javascript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const saveData = async () => {
  try {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem('myKey', 'myValue');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('AsyncStorage error:', error);
  }
};
```
